Module aimed at gathering the functions for financial analysis.
Ultimately, it should include:
    initial investment assessment, net present value, loan repayment

    """
    Function computing the initial investment cost.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pvps: pvpumpingsystem.PVPumpSystem,
        The Photovoltaic pumping system whose cost is to be analyzed.

    labour_price_coefficient: float, default is 0.2
            Ratio of the price of labour and secondary costs (wires,
            racks (can be expensive!), transport of materials, etc) on initial
            investment. It is considered at 0.2 in Gualteros (2017),
            but is more around 0.40 in Tarpuy(Peru) case.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Initial investment for the whole pumping system.

    opex: float, default is 0
